# TweakScaleLimited
This is a set of module manager configs that will alter how much you can scale parts when using TweakScale and what kind of parts can be scaled.  

A new intermediate size is placed between each of the stock sizes, so the size progression becomes this.  
0.3125 ,0.625 ,0.9375 ,1.25 ,1.875 ,2.5 ,3.125 ,3.75 ,4.375 ,5.0 ,6.25 ,7.5, 8.75, 10, 12.5

In general, parts can go down two steps smaller and up one step larger from their base size.  It gives most parts 4 different size choices you can jump to on the size progression list.   

These files create new limited range scale types and apply them to all parts based on the current tweakscale module on the part
Adapters.cfg
FreeScales.cfg
StackScales.cfg
StackSquareScales.cfg

zForbig removes scaling from parts based on the modules on the parts

zInclude adds scaling to select parts to fix issues by all the previous patches
