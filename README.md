# TweakScaleLimited
This is a set of module manager configs that will alter how much you can scale parts when using TweakScale.  I love the mod, but for a career game it really messes with the progression of unlocking larger parts as you go.  These are the things the configs are intended to accomplish. 

A new intermediate size is placed between each of the stock sizes, so the size progression becomes this.  
0.3125 ,0.625 ,0.9375 ,1.25 ,1.875 ,2.5 ,3.125 ,3.75 ,4.375 ,5.0 ,6.25 ,7.5, 8.75, 10, 12.5

In general, parts can go down two steps smaller and up one step larger from their base size.  It gives most parts 4 different size choices you can jump to on the size progression list, but you can still click the bar to get any size in-between.   

Scaling is removed from all crewed parts and science parts.  I feel this is needed to keep the gameplay balanced.  You can still make quite small probes, but scaling things gigantic is a thing of the past.
